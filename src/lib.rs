/*!
A crate to allow running a [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) webserver as an AWS Lambda Function with API Gateway, built on the [AWS Lambda Rust Runtime](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime).

The function takes a request from an AWS API Gateway Proxy and converts it into a `LocalRequest` to pass to Rocket. Then it will convert the response from Rocket into the response body that API Gateway understands.

This *should* also work with requests from an AWS Application Load Balancer, but this has not been tested.

## Usage

```rust,no_run
#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
use rocket_lamb::RocketExt;

#[get("/")]
fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    rocket::ignite()
        .mount("/hello", routes![hello])
        .lambda() // launch the Rocket as a Lambda
        .launch().await;
}
```
*/

    fn lambda(self) -> RocketHandlerBuilder {
        RocketHandlerBuilder::new(self)
    }
